#Campus Management System: Server


This is the server-side (back-end) code for Web Dev Final Project â€“ Campus Management System. 
Built with Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, it provides the RESTful routes that 
let the app create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) campus and student records. 
The front-end calls these routes to keep data in sync, while this back-end handles all database logic, validation, and error handling.
